        Well Shit. I didn't think anyone would find <a href="/page3.html" id="secretLink">this</a>. <br><br><br>
        There's not much left here to find, just an invisble link on an otherwise nondiscript page. <br><br>
        No need to keep searching for anything. <br><br>
        It's <article id="key1">like</article> that time I lost my house Key and had to kick in the window to the basement.   <br><br><br>
        I never found the key, but I did find a way in. <br><br>
        But this isn't <article id="key2">like</article> that. <br><br>
        There is no need to keep looking. <br><br><br>
        Stop. <br><br>
    </div>

    I don't "Like" this.
